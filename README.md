Thozhi is a comprehensive safety ecosystem built to bridge the gap between women in distress and immediate help. Named after the Tamil word for "Female Friend," the app acts as a digital companion that’s always awake, always watching, and always ready to act.

## The Vision
In a world where safety is often reactive, Thozhi aims to be proactive. We've combined real-time geolocation, automated evidence gathering, and a dedicated "Police Akka" (Female Officer) network into a single, intuitive interface. 

## Core Capabilities

### 🛡️ Smart SOS Echo
A single tap doesn't just send a text. It triggers a multi-layered response:
*   **Audio Recording**: Starts recording immediately to capture evidence.
*   **Live Cloud Sync**: Uploads recordings in real-time so they can't be deleted locally.
*   **Squad Alert**: Notifies your pre-set emergency contacts with your exact coordinates.

### 👮 Police Akka Network
We've digitized the community policing model. You can locate and track nearby female officers who are trained to handle sensitive situations. It’s not just a map; it’s a direct line to protection.

### 🤝 The "My Squad" System
Safety is better with friends. Link with your family or inner circle using a unique **Safety ID**. They can watch your journey in real-time, receiving alerts if you veer off-course or stop unexpectedly.

### 📍 Verified Safe Routes
Moving through the city at night? Our algorithm suggests routes based on lighting levels and historical safety data, ensuring you take the path most traveled by the community.
